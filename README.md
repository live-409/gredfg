Tiger Woods, Kevin Kisner, and Tom Kim will be the lineup for Jupiter in this one.

The group was very efficient in that match, hitting the fairway on all 15 tee shots.


New York comes in looking for its first win of the season. Its last match was on Jan. 21, and was a 4-0 loss to Atlanta. New York’s lineup for this match will be Rickie Fowler, Matthew Fitzpatrick, and Cameron Young. Young comes into the week averaging 338.8 yards per drive this season, which leads all of The Golf League. Despite being 0-2 on the season, New York leads the league in both team average drive distance (321.7 yards) and percentage of fairways hit (80%).
